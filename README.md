# About
I stole most of this from Jack The Frog aka Washanus The Soupeater.

# Installation
1. Symlink what you need, like:

  ```
  ln -s $(pwd)/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
  ```

2. Install Vundle.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
  ```

3. Open Vim and install plugins.

  ```
  vim
  :PluginInstall
  ```

I borrowed the syntax file for OpenCL C from [here](https://github.com/vim-scripts/opencl.vim).
